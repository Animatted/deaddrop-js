#  deaddrop-js

A deaddrop utility written in Typescript. Put files in a database behind a password to be retrieved at a later date.

This is a part of the University of Wyoming's Secure Software Design Course (Spring 2023). This is the base repository to be forked and updated for various assignments. Alternative language versions are available in:
- [Go](https://github.com/andey-robins/deaddrop-go)
- [Rust](https://github.com/andey-robins/deaddrop-rs)

## Versioning

`deaddrop-js` is built with:
- node v18.13.0

## Usage

`npm run build && node dist/index.js --help` for instructions

Then run `node dist/index.js --new --user <username here>` and you will be prompted to create the initial password.

## Database

Data gets stored into the local database file dd.db. This file will not by synched to git repos. Delete this file if you don't set up a user properly on the first go

## Mitigation 

A usage log is currently updated on the use of verbs 'read', 'new', or 'send'. This log includes the user that invoked the verb, the verb itself, and the time/date 
that it was invoked. 

## TODO

Expand logging system to include more usage information.
Implement another mitigation system.
